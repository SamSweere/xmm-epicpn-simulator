The most current CCF can be downloaded here: https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/current-calibration-files

The files we are using are the most current as of August 29, 2023. More current files will have a greater number before 
the ending .CCF. When looking for the files we ignore the number, i.e., EPN_LINCOORD*.CCF and XMM_MISCDATA*.CCF, 
sort them in ascending order according by their name and take the last entry, i.e., the most recent .CCF.
